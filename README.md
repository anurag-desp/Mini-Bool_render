# Mini Bool

  A program to minimise a Boolean Expression and display Kmap for 2, 3, 4 varibles.
  But you can use as many variables as required.

  I made this project under the guidence of my professor, **Dr. Tusarkanti Dash Sir**, as a part of my Experiential Learning on the course - **Switching Circuits and Logic Design**
